         Matching furniture and raw materials
         </header>
    <p> The <code>design</code> of private homes and villas must include a choice of stylish furniture that suits the space and lifestyle.</p>
    <p> Furniture has the power to change any <code>space</code> so the choice must be meticulous.
         So even if we love something it can not always fit into our<code>space</code> and it is important to remember.
         The raw materials that will be in the <code>space</code> must also match each other if the <code>space</code> is designed mostly
         in wood and the style is rustic and it would not be appropriate to incorporate plastic furniture for the dodge.
         herefore an interior designer can make the combination together with you and make sure that there will be a homogeneous fit in any style you choose.
